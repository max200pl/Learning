# Math Study Environment

This environment is set up to help you efficiently study and organize your math notes and projects.

## File Organization
Create a structured folder system for your math notes:

```
ðŸ“‚ Math
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Algebra
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ equations.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ matrices.md
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Calculus
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ derivatives.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ integrals.md
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Geometry
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ theorems.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ constructions.md
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ Projects
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project1.ipynb
```

## Hotkeys for Convenience
Set up frequently used commands to streamline your workflow:

- **Open Markdown preview:**
  - `Ctrl+Shift+V` â€” open preview side by side.
- **Compile LaTeX:**
  - `Ctrl+Alt+B` â€” build .tex document.
- **Jupyter Notebook:**
  - `Shift+Enter` â€” run cell.

## Set Theme and Icons
- Use a theme with soft colors for comfortable reading (e.g., GitHub Light).
- Install the Material Icon Theme extension for easy folder navigation.

## Useful Tips
- For simple math notes, use Markdown (.md) with LaTeX support.
- For complex projects or calculations, use Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).
- For academic documents, use LaTeX (.tex).
