# Signals Angular 16+

## Overview

Signals are a new way to manage state and reactivity in Angular applications. They provide a more efficient and predictable way to handle changes in application state compared to traditional change detection mechanisms. Signals are designed to work seamlessly with Angular's existing features, such as components, directives, and services.

```typescript

import { signal } from '@angular/core';

export class AppComponent {
  // Define a signal to hold the count value
  count = signal(0);

  // Method to increment the count
  increment() {
    this.count.update(value => value + 1);
  }
}
```
