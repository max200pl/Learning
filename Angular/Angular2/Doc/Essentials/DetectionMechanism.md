# Detection Mechanism

## Overview

### zone.js

zone.js is a library that provides a way to execute asynchronous code in a controlled environment. It allows you to track the execution context of asynchronous operations, such as setTimeout, promises, and event listeners. This is particularly useful in Angular applications, where you want to ensure that changes to the application state are detected and reflected in the UI.
