# Angular Modules of Components

## Introduction

Angular modules are a way to group related components, directives, pipes, and services together. They help in organizing the application into cohesive blocks of functionality. Each Angular application has at least one module, the root module, which is typically named `AppModule`. Additional modules can be created to encapsulate specific features or functionalities.
