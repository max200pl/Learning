# Main Angular concepts

## The Angular CLI

The Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that helps developers create, manage, and build Angular applications. It provides a set of commands to automate common tasks, such as generating components, services, and modules, running tests, and building the application for production.

### Installation

To install the Angular CLI, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Once you have them installed, you can use the following command to install the Angular CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Creating a new Angular application

To create a new Angular application, you can use the `ng new` command followed by the name of your application. For example:

```bash
ng new my-angular-app
```

## Start the development server

To start the development server and serve your application, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
