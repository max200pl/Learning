## Introduction

### CPU

- Central Processing Unit
- The brain of the computer
- Executes instructions

### RAM

- Random Access Memory
- Short-term memory
- Stores data that is currently being used

### Hard Drive

- Long-term memory
- Stores data even when the computer is turned off
- Slower than RAM
- More storage than RAM

### How Computers Store Data

- Computers store data in binary

```javascript

// 1 byte = 8 bits
Math.pow(2, 8); // 256 possibilities

// infinite possibilities -> 1 byte can store 256 different values
Math.pow(6, 1000); // 1.8 * 10^956 possibilities (more than atoms in the universe) -> infinite possibilities

```

### Data Structures in Programming

- A way of organizing and storing data
- We want to be able to:
  - Store data
  - Access data
  - Perform operations on the data

### Types of Data Structures

- Arrays
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Tries
- Graphs
- Hash Maps
- Heaps
- Vectors
- Matrices
- Sets
- Graphs
- Dictionaries
- Hash Tables

### Operations on Data Structures

1. Insertion - Adding an item to a data structure
2. Deletion - Removing an item from a data structure
3. Traversal - Visiting all the nodes in a data structure
4. Searching - Finding an item in a data structure
5. Sorting - Arranging items in a data structure in a specific order
6. Access - Retrieving data from a data structure
