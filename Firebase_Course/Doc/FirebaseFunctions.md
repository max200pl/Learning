<https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started?gen=1st>

FirebaseFunctions is a class that provides a set of functions to interact with Firebase. It is a subclass of Firebase.

## Initialization

```bash

firebase init functions

```

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

i  Using project portfolio-react-5b7d3 (Portfolio React)

=== Functions Setup
Let's create a new codebase for your functions.
A directory corresponding to the codebase will be created in your project
with sample code pre-configured.

See <https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/organize-functions> for
more information on organizing your functions using codebases.

Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.
